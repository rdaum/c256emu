o65 executable relocator and runner written in 65816 (ca65) assembler.

See: http://www.6502.org/users/andre/o65/

TODO:
	* Support exported labels (like "main"?)
	* Support the 'chain' bit.
	* Reject 'obj' files. You can't run them.
	* Respect the 'bsszero' flag.
	* Pay attention to 'simple' bit. We just assume it.
	* Do something with 'align'?
	* Look at the CPU2 flag, flip into emulation mode if
	  necessary
	* More error handling & sanity checking throughout.
	* Do something with the header options.
	* Test 16-bit binaries
	* Test HIGH relocations. Should work, but does it?
